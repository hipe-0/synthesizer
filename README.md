My own DIY synthesizer, created by me in january 2024.
The audio processing is running on one Teensy 4.1 microprocessor.
The spec and interface is inspired by the 1970 Minimoog model D analogue synthesizer, but modernised: multiphonic, usb-midi, 12 waveforms, use of linear potentiometers (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog)

Features
- 26x faders
- 3x voices
- 12x selectable waveforms on each voice
- up to 4x notes simultaneously
- Monophonic / Multiphonic
- 1x low pass resonnant filter
- 1x LFO
- 1x envelope for amplitude
- 1x envelope for filter cutoff
- 3x modulation destinations: pitch, filter cut-off and pulse-width
- 3x modulation sources: modwheel, LFO, waveform 3
- modulation listen to midi controller mod wheel
- pitch bend
- Core : teensy 4.1 microcontroller board
- 7x LEDs
- LCD display, give text feedback about notes and knobs changed
- usb midi In
- usb host (to plug a usb midi keyboard on it)
