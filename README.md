This DIY synthesizer was created by me in january 2024. (design, assembly, test, code)

Inspiration: The spec and interface is inspired by the 1970 Minimoog model D analogue synthesizer (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog)
But I have modernised it to my taste : 4 voices multiphonic, usb-midi, 12 waveforms, use of 5 linear potentiometers, LCD screen with user feedback, slight delay effect on audio output, surprise resonator added to audio feedback loop

# Short demo
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83d63550-5824-47d2-82ff-21bb06fb89ea

# Features
- 6x faders, 20x potentiometers, 4x rotary switches and 7x switches for audio control
- 3x voices
- Up to 4x notes simultaneously
- 12x selectable waveforms on each voice
- 1x octave selector for the 3x voices (12 presets)
- Monophonic / Multiphonic
- 1x low pass resonnant filter (typical Moog ladder filter simulation from https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Audio/blob/master/filter_ladder.h)
- 1x LFO (low frequency oscilator)
- 2x Envelopes for amplitude and filter cutoff
- 3x Modulation sources: LFO or waveform 3 or noise
- 3x Modulation destinations: pitch, filter cut-off and pulse-width
- Modulation listen to midi controller mod wheel (no physical mod wheel on the synth itself)
- Pitch bend from midi controller (no physical pitch bend wheel on the synth itself)
- 7x LEDs
- LCD display, give text feedback about notes and knobs changed
- USB midi In
- USB host (to plug a usb midi keyboard on it)
- Currently mono audio output signal
- Audio processing via 1x Teensy 4.1 microprocessor and a dedicated audio shield (similar to a sound card for a PC)
