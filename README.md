This DIY synthesizer was created by me in january 2024. (design, assembly, test, code)

Inspiration: The spec and interface is inspired by the 1970 Minimoog model D analogue synthesizer (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog)
But I have it modernised: 4 voices multiphonic, usb-midi, 12 waveforms, use of linear potentiometers
